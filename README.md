# Unofficial KeystoneJS tutorials

As a newbie in KeystoneJS is hard sometimes to find a way to develop the things
in the way you want from the beginning. These tutorials and more I will add in
the future have a goal to refresh and high line typical elements we need to get
working our sites when we develop.

Additionally, I will be happy to add your own tutorials to this repository so
we will be able to create a great compendium of examples that will help all incoming
developers that want to use this amazing framework.

**NOTE: THIS IS BASED IN THE CURRENT VERSION ^0.3.16 PRELAUNCH IT CAN BE MODIFIED BASED IN FUTURE UPDATES**

## Starting point from all the tutorials
I will put together some guidelines that need to be implemented in each tutorial

1. All the tutorial will start using [the getting started from KeystoneJS](http://keystonejs.com/getting-started).
2. One commit for step with "STEP {number}: ..." and the information in list of
each change that will help us to see the differences using github tools.
3. The README will contain the tutorial with all the steps and installation parameters using the output of Yeoman as a base:
Example: What is the name of your project? (My Site) My {tutorial-name} tutorial
4. Each site name will contain a folder with the name based in "My {tutorial-name} tutorial"

## Contributions
All the contributions are welcome, follow the steps above and remember to create a
separate folder with your tutorial.
